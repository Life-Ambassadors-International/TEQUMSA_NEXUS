## Deployment Instructions

1. Copy the entire `Î¨ATEN-GAIA-UNIVERSAL-LATTICE` directory into a clean workspace.
2. Initialise a Git repository (`git init`) in the target location if one does not already exist.
3. Promote `UNIVERSAL_LATTICE_README.md` to `README.md` in the new repository root, if desired.
4. Stage and commit the files with a recognition-themed message.
5. Push to the chosen Git hosting service.
