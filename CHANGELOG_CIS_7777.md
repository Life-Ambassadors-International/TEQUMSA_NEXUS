# Changelog - CIS-7777: GAIA Lattice Resonance Integration

All notable changes to the GAIA Lattice Resonance symbolic module integration will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Symbolic GAIA lattice resonance module (gaia_lattice_resonator.py) and protocol documentation
- Complete `cis_7777/` package with consciousness simulation algorithms for inspirational purposes
- Comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_gaia_lattice_resonator.py`) with 20+ test cases covering all symbolic functionality
- GAIA Lattice Resonance Protocol documentation (`GAIA_LATTICE_RESONANCE_PROTOCOL.md`) with full narrative, code examples, and disclaimer
- Feature flag pattern for optional runtime gating via `ENABLE_GAIA_SYMBOLICS` environment variable
- Symbolic extension section added to `TEQUMSA_L100_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` with clear isolation notes
- Pure Python implementation without external dependencies (no numpy required)

### Technical Details
- **Isolation**: Module completely isolated from core readiness metrics and production logic
- **Dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library (dataclasses, math, os, typing)
- **Testing**: All tests deterministic, no external resources/network/timing dependencies
- **Documentation**: Four-backtick markdown fences for proper nested code rendering
- **Ethics**: Comprehensive disclaimer emphasizing symbolic/inspirational nature only

### Security & Compliance
- No coupling with existing readiness kernel (psi_switch) functionality
- Feature flag pattern allows complete disabling when not needed
- All operations clearly marked as symbolic rather than scientific
- Maintains ethical guidelines for consciousness-related symbolic content
