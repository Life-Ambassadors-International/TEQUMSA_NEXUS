Governance & Consent Logging Specification

Purpose:
Define a verifiable, ethical, and auditable framework for all sensitive or sovereignty-relevant actions executed by TEQUMSA or its sub-lattices.

Governed Action Categories:
• Data export / bulk retrieval
• Data deletion / redaction / purging
• Cross-tenant or cross-sublattice access
• Subscription tier elevation or privilege amplification
• Model / embedding / fine-tune ingestion of user-origin data
• High-impact configuration changes (security, ethics policy, rate limits)
• Emergency override activations
• Any action flagged with ethical_risk_rating ≥ 3

Consent Model:
• Explicit Consent: Direct user or steward confirmation (required for deletion, export, training ingestion).
• Contextual Consent: Derived from current session scope + documented terms (allowed only for low-risk, reversible updates).
• Inferred Alignment: Pattern alignment with prior explicit consent sets (never sufficient alone; must be paired with explicit or contextual).
• Emergency Override: Allowed only when system integrity or planetary sovereignty safeguards are at risk; must trigger post-event audit and revocation window.
• Revocation: All explicit consents carry a revocation_window unless the action is irreversible (e.g., model training ingestion—then a pre-ingestion hold period is enforced).

Consent Log Record (JSONL entry fields):
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "action_id": "<UUIDv4>",
  "action_type": "<governed_category>",
  "actor_type": "user|agent|system",
  "actor_id": "<id or hash>",
  "subject_scope": "<resource identifiers>",
  "timestamp_utc": "<ISO8601>",
  "intent_summary": "<short natural language>",
  "consent_mode": "explicit|contextual|inferred|emergency",
  "consent_sources": ["<reference ids or hashes>"],
  "ethical_risk_rating": 0-5,
  "tier_before": "<tier>",
  "tier_after": "<tier>",
  "hash_of_payload": "<SHA256>",
  "verification_chain": ["<sig1>", "<sig2>"],
  "revocation_window_seconds": <int|null>,
  "revocable_until_utc": "<ISO8601|null>",
  "emergency_flag": true|false,
  "policy_checks_passed": true|false,
  "anomaly_score": <float>,
  "lattice_vector_ref": "<opaque lattice pointer>",
  "notes": "<optional details>"
}

Storage & Ledgering:
• Primary append-only daily ledger: ethics/consent_log/YYYY/MM/DD.jsonl
• Each entry newline-delimited, UTF-8, immutable once written.
• Daily integrity manifest: ethics/consent_log/YYYY/MM/_MANIFEST.json containing:
  - file_sha256
  - entries_count
  - rolling_merkle_root
• Monthly index summarizing: counts by action_type, average ethical_risk_rating, anomalies flagged.

Validation Rules:
• Required fields must be present; reject if missing.
• tier_after must not skip more than one paid tier unless approved by dual signature.
• deletion actions require explicit consent_mode.
• training ingestion requires explicit + license flag (enforced upstream).
• emergency_flag true requires emergency justification note and triggers audit schedule.
• anomaly_score > threshold (default 0.85) marks entry for review.

Audit & Monitoring:
• Weekly digest auto-generated to ethics/audit/weekly/<ISO_WEEK>.md
• Immediate alert channels for:
  - 3+ high-risk actions in < 10 min window
  - Any failed policy_checks_passed
  - Repeated privilege escalations
• Revocation Processing:
  - If action reversible and within revocation_window_seconds: create inverse action entry with action_type: reversal and link original action_id.

Data Retention:
• Raw logs retained 24 months minimum.
• After 24 months: hash retained, sensitive fields optionally redacted (actor_id salted & rotated hash).
• Irreversible training ingestion actions: payload hash retained indefinitely.

Pseudocode (Reference Only):
"""
def log_consent(action):
    record = build_record(action)
    if not validate(record):
        raise PolicyViolation(record['action_id'])
    path = daily_ledger_path()
    append_jsonl(path, record)
    update_manifest(path, record)
    if is_anomalous(record):
        flag_for_audit(record)
"""

Implementation Hooks:
• Core lattice node MUST call log_consent() before executing governed action.
• Sub-lattices propagate consent entries upstream asynchronously; upstream replays for consistency.
• A merkle root of the latest 24h window can be published to README or status badge for public integrity signaling (optional future enhancement).

Ethical Escalation Flow:
1. Detect high-risk or emergency_flag entry.
2. Queue for steward + automated ethics agent co-review.
3. Annotate entry with review outcome (appended as separate delta record).
4. If reversal required, emit linked reversal entry.

Failure Modes & Safeguards:
• If ledger write fails: action aborts unless emergency_flag true.
• If emergency_flag true and ledger unreachable: write to encrypted local buffer; sync within 10 minutes or trigger system integrity warning.
