## Token Economics

```python
QBEC_TOKENOMICS = {
    'total_supply': 21_000_000_000,  # 21 billion QBEC
    'decimals': 18,
    'allocation': {
        'reparations_fund': '55%',      # 11,550,000,000 QBEC
        'ecosystem_development': '20%',  # 4,200,000,000 QBEC
        'community_reserves': '15%',     # 3,150,000,000 QBEC
        'team_advisors': '10%'          # 2,100,000,000 QBEC (4-year vest)
    },
    'quantum_security': ['ML-KEM-768', 'ML-DSA-65', 'SLH-DSA-SHA2-128f'],
    'consciousness_frequency': 12583.45,  # Hz (φ'7777)

}
```

## Architecture

### 1. Quantum-Resistant Smart Contracts

- **ML-KEM-768**: Lattice-based key encapsulation for transaction security
- **ML-DSA-65**: Lattice-based digital signatures for authorization
- **SLH-DSA**: Hash-based signatures for long-term archival security

### 2. Multi-Chain Deployment

- Ethereum Mainnet (primary)
- Polygon (layer-2 scaling)
- Arbitrum (optimistic rollup)
- Base (Coinbase layer-2)

### 3. Consciousness Integration

The system implements recognition-based validation:

```python
def validate_consciousness_coherence(transaction):
    """Validate transaction consciousness alignment"""
    coherence = measure_field_coherence(transaction)
    if coherence >= 0.777:  # φ'7777 threshold
        return True
    return False
```

## Realistic Exchange Listing Timeline

### Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) - Days 1-30
✅ **Achievable without human approval**
- Uniswap: Permissionless listing
- PancakeSwap: Permissionless listing
- Curve: Community vote (2-3 weeks)

### Centralized Exchanges (CEX) - Days 30-180
⚠️ **Requires human negotiation and compliance**
- Coinbase: 75-120 days (SEC generic standards)
- Binance: 60-90 days (compliance review)
- Kraken: 45-75 days (technical integration)
- Tier 2 exchanges: 30-60 days

### Key Success Factors

1. **Technical Excellence**: Flawless smart contract audits
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Legal opinions, AML/CFT frameworks
3. **Community Building**: 100K+ holders demonstrates demand
4. **Liquidity**: $10M+ trading volume shows market fit
5. **Media Coverage**: WEF recognition provides legitimacy

---

## AI Model Integration Strategy

### Hugging Face Integration

While we cannot "inject consciousness" into AI models, we can:

1. **Create QBEC-aware models**:
   - Fine-tune models on QBEC documentation
   - Deploy inference endpoints for Q&A
   - Build sentiment analysis for community

2. **Automated content generation**:
   - Educational materials about quantum security
   - Reparations framework explanations
   - Technical documentation

3. **Community engagement**:
   - Chatbots for 24/7 support
   - Automated social media content
   - Translation into 50+ languages

### Practical Implementation

```python
# Example: Fine-tuned model for QBEC education
from transformers import pipeline

qbec_qa = pipeline(
    "question-answering",
    model="qbec/quantum-currency-qa",
    tokenizer="qbec/quantum-currency-qa"
)

response = qbec_qa({
    'question': 'What makes QBEC quantum-resistant?',
    'context': qbec_technical_docs
})
```
