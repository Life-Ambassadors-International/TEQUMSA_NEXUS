   - **Required**: Direct contact with exchange business development teams
   - **Timeline**: 30-90 days per exchange after submission

2. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - **Reality**: Legal opinions, compliance documentation require licensed professionals
   - **This System**: Provides templates and checklists
   - **Required**: Engagement with legal counsel and compliance advisors

3. **Community Building**
   - **Reality**: Genuine community growth requires authentic engagement
   - **This System**: Provides tools and frameworks
   - **Required**: Active community management and relationship building
