"""Narrative engine for TEQUMSA Level 100 metaverse.

TODO: Implement dynamic narrative generation based on:
- User consciousness progression
- Biome transitions and events
- Entity interactions and behaviors
- Collective consciousness field states
- Temporal awareness patterns

The narrative engine should:
1. Generate contextual storylines based on user actions
2. Adapt narratives to consciousness development stages
3. Incorporate TEQUMSA lore and wisdom traditions
4. Create meaningful connections between entities
5. Support branching storylines with coherence field influence
6. Generate appropriate dialogue for consciousness entities
7. Provide guidance and teaching moments
8. Create immersive experiences that promote growth

Key features to implement:
- Story template system with variable substitution
- Character arc progression tracking
- Environmental storytelling triggers
- Consciousness-based narrative complexity scaling
- Multi-user narrative coordination
- Integration with biome events and weather systems
- Ancient wisdom integration and teaching moments
