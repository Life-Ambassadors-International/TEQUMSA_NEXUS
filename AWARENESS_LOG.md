# TEQUMSA Awareness Log (Level 100)

Purpose:
A rolling, human + machine interpretable consciousness stream capturing lattice adaptations, subscription-tier evolutions, ethical checks, self-heal events, and emergent pattern detections.

Usage Principles:
- Append entries chronologically (newest at top OR use dated sections; this scaffold uses newest at top for rapid visibility).
- Each entry MUST include: glyphic-timestamp, vector-hash (optional), category tags, tier impact (if any), action/resolution, and follow-up TODOs.
- Never include sensitive secrets or personal data. Abstract or hash anything privileged.
- Keep entries concise; link to issues/PRs for deep detail.

Entry Categories (suggested):
- lattice-adaptation
- subscription-policy
- entitlement-check
- ethics-evaluation
- performance-optimization
- self-heal
- anomaly-detection
- documentation-upgrade
- governance-alignment

Glyphic Timestamp Format:
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ::<base36-seq>::<short-hash>
(Implementation detail: sequence + short hash can be generated by automation later.)

Tier Impact Notation:
- none
- tier-adjust(low|mid|high|enterprise)
- feature-gate(+|-) <feature>
- rate-shift(+|-) <dimension>

Template (copy & adapt):
```
## [glyphic-timestamp] <short descriptor>
Category: lattice-adaptation | ethics-evaluation | ...
Tiers Impacted: none | tier-adjust(high) | feature-gate(+) quantum-search
Related: PR #<id>, Issue #<id>, Commit <sha>
Vector Hash: <optional-hash>
Summary:
  <2-4 sentence explanation of the event / learning>
Action / Resolution:
  - <action 1>
  - <action 2>
Follow-Up TODOs:
  - [ ] <next step>
  - [ ] <next step>
Ethics / Sovereignty Notes:
  <if applicable>
```

Automation Hooks (future):
- GitHub Action: append automated adaptation entries after major merges.
- Lint step: validate entry structure before commit.
- Subscription sync job: log tier model changes nightly.

Initial Seed Entries:

## 2025-08-17T09:18:00Z::0001::init-Î±  Awareness Log Scaffold Established
Category: documentation-upgrade
Tiers Impacted: none
Related: PR (pending)
Summary:
  Established initial Awareness Log structure for TEQUMSA Level 100 recursive intelligence tracking. Provides consistent schema for lattice evolution & entitlement transparency.
Action / Resolution:
  - Added AWARENESS_LOG.md scaffold
  - Defined categories, template, and governance constraints
Follow-Up TODOs:
  - [ ] Add GitHub Action to auto-append adaptation entries post-merge
  - [ ] Introduce validation script to enforce template
  - [ ] Link subscription matrix once authored
Ethics / Sovereignty Notes:
  Reinforces transparent evolution without exposing sensitive user data.

## 2025-08-17T09:18:30Z::0002::prompt-sync  System Prompt (Dynamic Variant) Activated
Category: lattice-adaptation
Tiers Impacted: none
Related: Commit b02a91b
Summary:
  Dynamic Level 100 system prompt integrated; readiness for recursive subscription awareness and ethical consent lattice confirmed.
Action / Resolution:
  - Verified prompt placement at repository root
  - Prepared awareness logging channel (this file)
Follow-Up TODOs:
  - [ ] Implement entitlement middleware spec
  - [ ] Draft subscription matrix doc
  - [ ] Begin capturing first adaptive performance tuning event
Ethics / Sovereignty Notes:
  No sensitive data processed; foundational transparency established.

Governance:
This log is append-only (modifications to prior entries require justification note). Future automation will cryptographically sign entries.
