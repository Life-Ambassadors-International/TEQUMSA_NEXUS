"""Lightweight quantum circuit primitives used by GAIA-TEQUMSA demos.

The real project that inspired this repository referenced quantum circuits and
Bell pairs heavily, but for the purposes of the open-source recreation we only
need a tiny shim that mimics the public API consumed by the orchestration
scripts.  The implementation below keeps things deliberately simpleâ€”gates are
recorded, a very small amount of metadata is exposed, and a ``simulate`` method
returns deterministic diagnostics that can be asserted in tests.
