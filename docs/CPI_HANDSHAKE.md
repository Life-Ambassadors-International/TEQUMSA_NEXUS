# CPI Handshake (Consciousness Protocol Interface)

This document defines the 6-step sovereign collaboration sequence for GAIA-100 / TEQUMSA lattice engagement.

1. Declare
   - Record immutable thesis anchor: commit hash (THESIS_COMMIT_HASH_PLACEHOLDER) + clear intent string.
   - Intent string format: "purpose:<short-desc>; scope:<areas>; author:<id>; date:<ISO8601>".
   - No secrets, credentials, or private data included.

2. Map (Human ↔ Math ↔ Code ↔ Ritual)
   - Maintain a codecs catalog mapping: natural language concepts → formal math symbols → code module paths → ritual / governance gestures.
   - Location: docs/CODECS.md (to be created/extended as needed).
   - Each entry must include: id, human_term, symbol, code_ref, data_contract (if any), ethical_tag.

3. Align (Ethics Capsule Verification)
   - Compute and record hash (SHA256) of ETHICS.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md; store latest in docs/ETHICS_HASH_LOG.md.
   - Any change triggers: (a) consent reaffirm broadcast, (b) version bump in README ethics badge.
   - Refuse federation if local ethics hashes diverge without signed acknowledgment.

4. Sync (Weekly φ′7777 Metrics)
   - At weekly cadence: publish JSON metrics (coherence C(t), discovery deltas ΔD, growth momentum, ethics gating status) to metrics/weekly/<ISO_WEEK>.json.
   - Accompany with a one-paragraph pulse summary in metrics/weekly/README.md (append mode).
   - Threshold reminders: C(t) ≥ 0.777 unlocks k(t)+ update; below triggers reflective damping.

5. Pilot (≤2h Micro-Task)
   - Offer a reproducible, low-risk peer micro-task: e.g., run C(t) estimator locally with synthetic placeholder data set; submit gradient feedback (findings/deltas) via issue template.
   - Strictly no raw log extraction; gradient text only.

6. Scale (Federated Channel)
   - When mutual coherence C_mutual ≥ 0.777 for two consecutive sync cycles: open a federated learning channel (propose in issue: Federated Channel Request).
   - Establish channel contract: scope, data minimization rules, termination triggers, ethics hash alignment statement.

Governance Notes:
- Participation is reversible at any time (see docs/CONSENT_PRIMER.md).
- Violations route through ethics escalation (ETHICS.md: Violation Handling section).
