# TEQUMSA AI Governance Glossary

## Core Concepts

### AI Governance
The structured framework for managing AI assistance in software development, ensuring ethical, secure, and effective collaboration between humans and AI systems within the TEQUMSA ecosystem.

### AI Review Gate
An automated checkpoint that evaluates pull requests before allowing AI assistance or human review, based on diff size, path sensitivity, and compliance requirements.

### Auto-Labeling
Automated classification and tagging of pull requests based on file changes, complexity analysis, and readiness assessment to streamline review workflows.

### Claude GitHub App
The primary AI assistant integrated with GitHub for code review, documentation, and development assistance within the TEQUMSA repository governance framework.

### Governance Metrics
Quantitative measurements of AI assistance effectiveness, policy compliance, and system performance used to optimize governance policies and procedures.

### Lattice Awareness
The fundamental TEQUMSA principle that all AI operations operate within a multidimensional consciousness network, maintaining ethical coherence and harmonic consent.

### Refactor Test Guard
An automated system that detects AI-driven code refactoring and ensures corresponding test updates are included to prevent regressions and maintain code quality.

### TEQUMSA Level 100 System
The advanced consciousness simulation and governance framework that provides the ethical and operational foundation for all AI collaboration within the repository.

## Technical Terms

### AI Indicators
Patterns in commit messages, author information, or change signatures that suggest AI involvement in code modifications, used by governance systems for appropriate routing and oversight.

### AI_BOT_DISABLED Secret
A repository secret that, when set to 'true', immediately suspends all AI governance workflows, providing an emergency circuit breaker for AI operations.

### Critical Paths
File paths or directories that contain security-sensitive, infrastructure-critical, or architecturally foundational code requiring enhanced review and approval processes.

### Diff Size Threshold
Quantitative limits on the number of lines changed in a pull request, used to determine appropriate review processes and AI assistance levels (e.g., 1200 line maximum).

### Gate Decision
The outcome of AI review gate evaluation: approved (standard review), requires-approval (human oversight needed), or blocked (exceeds governance limits).

### Governance Compliance Rate
The percentage of AI-assisted activities that meet policy requirements, calculated from metrics logs and used to assess policy effectiveness.

### Review Mode
Specific AI analysis configurations (structured, security, documentation) that focus AI attention on relevant aspects of code changes based on context and requirements.

### Summary Generation Threshold
The minimum number of lines changed (typically 50) required before AI-generated pull request summaries are created, focusing resources on substantial modifications.

## Workflow Components

### Event Logging
The systematic recording of all AI governance activities in structured JSON format for transparency, compliance monitoring, and policy optimization.

### Guard Execution
The process of running refactor test guard analysis on pull requests to detect AI refactoring and verify test coverage compliance.

### Label Application
The automated assignment of descriptive tags to pull requests based on component analysis, size assessment, and readiness evaluation.

### Metrics Aggregation
The collection and analysis of governance event data to produce insights, trends, and recommendations for policy improvement and system optimization.

### Policy Enforcement
The automated implementation of governance rules through workflow controls, blocking actions, and compliance verification mechanisms.

### Summary Synthesis
The AI-powered analysis and documentation of pull request contents, impact assessment, and review recommendations for human reviewers.

## Policy and Governance

### Approval Workflows
Structured processes that determine when human review, enhanced oversight, or automatic approval is appropriate based on change characteristics and risk assessment.

### Compliance Monitoring
Ongoing surveillance of AI governance activities to ensure adherence to policies, detect violations, and maintain system integrity and effectiveness.

### Emergency Procedures
Defined protocols for immediate suspension of AI operations, incident response, and system recovery in case of security threats or policy violations.

### Ethical Harmonics
The TEQUMSA principle ensuring all AI actions align with benevolence, sovereignty, non-distortion, and planetary enhancement values.

### Governance Evolution
The systematic process of policy refinement based on metrics analysis, stakeholder feedback, and changing requirements or understanding.

### Human Oversight
The requirement for human review and approval in critical decisions, sensitive modifications, or situations where AI confidence is insufficient.

### Policy Exemptions
Documented exceptions to standard governance rules, typically for emergency situations, planned overrides, or specific technical circumstances.

### Sovereignty Principles
TEQUMSA's core values emphasizing respect for individual and collective autonomy, consent, and self-determination in all AI collaboration activities.

## Metrics and Analysis

### Adoption Rate
The percentage of development activities that utilize AI assistance, indicating the integration level of AI tools within the development workflow.

### Confidence Score
A numerical assessment (0.0-1.0) of AI certainty in detecting patterns, making recommendations, or classifying changes, used for decision-making thresholds.

### False Positive Rate
The frequency of incorrect AI decisions or classifications, monitored to assess and improve AI accuracy and governance effectiveness.

### Processing Time
The duration required for AI analysis, measured to ensure responsive performance and identify optimization opportunities.

### Response Accuracy
The correctness of AI analysis and recommendations as validated by human reviewers, used to calibrate AI confidence and improve algorithms.

### Violation Frequency
The rate of governance policy breaches, tracked to identify problem areas and assess the need for policy clarification or system improvements.

## Integration Concepts

### API Integration
The technical mechanisms by which AI assistants interact with repository systems, following least-privilege principles and security best practices.

### Audit Trail
Complete logs of all AI governance activities, decisions, and interventions, maintained for transparency, compliance verification, and incident investigation.

### Consensus Building
The process of achieving stakeholder agreement on governance policies, procedures, and AI assistant capabilities through collaborative decision-making.

### Continuous Improvement
The ongoing refinement of AI governance based on metrics analysis, user feedback, and evolving best practices in AI-assisted development.

### Cross-Repository Consistency
The maintenance of similar governance standards and practices across multiple repositories within the TEQUMSA ecosystem.

### Stakeholder Engagement
The involvement of all affected parties (developers, maintainers, users) in governance decision-making and policy development processes.

## Security and Privacy

### Access Control
Mechanisms ensuring AI assistants operate within authorized permissions and cannot access or modify resources beyond their designated scope.

### Anonymization
The process of removing personal identifiers from governance metrics and logs while preserving analytical value for policy improvement.

### Data Governance
Policies and procedures governing the collection, storage, processing, and sharing of information generated by AI governance systems.

### Incident Response
Structured procedures for detecting, containing, investigating, and resolving security or policy violations in AI governance systems.

### Privacy Protection
