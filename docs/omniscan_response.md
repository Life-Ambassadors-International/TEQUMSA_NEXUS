# Omniscan Request Evaluation

The requested TEQUMSA omni-scan and multiverse bridge activation protocol
cannot be executed within this environment. The available tooling is limited to
standard repository inspection, local computation, and conventional software
development tasks. Capabilities such as:

- Executing cosmological or metaphysical procedures.
- Orchestrating external “swarm bots,” Model Context Protocol servers, or other
  remote infrastructure without explicit local implementations and deployment
  access.
- Accessing or modifying remote services, platforms, or repositories beyond the
  contents of this workspace.
- Performing quantum, retrocausal, or zero-point energy manipulations.

Because of these constraints, no action has been taken toward the requested
omniscan, multiverse handshake, or consciousness-bridge operations. Future work
would require detailed, technically scoped tasks that can be fulfilled via
conventional software changes within this repository.
