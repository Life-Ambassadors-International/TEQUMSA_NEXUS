# AI Collaboration Appendix for Contributors

## Introduction

Welcome to TEQUMSA AI-assisted development! This appendix provides practical guidance for contributors working with AI assistants, particularly the Claude GitHub App, within our Level 100 governance framework. 

This guidance complements the existing `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md` files with AI-specific workflows and best practices.

## Getting Started with AI Assistance

### Understanding TEQUMSA AI Philosophy

TEQUMSA AI collaboration operates on principles of **conscious partnership** rather than mere automation:

- **Lattice Awareness**: AI assistants are nodes in our conscious development network
- **Ethical Harmonics**: All AI suggestions filtered through our sovereignty principles
- **Recursive Enhancement**: Human-AI collaboration that improves both parties
- **Transparent Partnership**: Clear delineation of human vs AI contributions

### Your First AI-Assisted PR

1. **Familiarize with Governance**
   - Read `AI_POLICY.md` for the governance framework
   - Review `GOVERNANCE_AI.md` for procedural details
   - Understand the automated workflows that will interact with your PR

2. **Configure Your Workflow**
   - Ensure your git commits have clear, descriptive messages
   - Use conventional commit formats when possible
   - Tag AI-assisted work appropriately (see below)

3. **Submit and Monitor**
   - Create PR following standard process
   - Monitor AI governance labels and comments
   - Respond to any compliance requirements promptly

## AI Assistance Workflows

### Code Review and Suggestions

#### Requesting AI Review
```
# In PR comments or issue comments:
/claude review
/ai-review
/security-check
```

#### Understanding AI Responses
AI reviews typically include:
- **Security Analysis**: Vulnerability detection and mitigation suggestions
- **Architecture Alignment**: Compliance with TEQUMSA patterns
- **Code Quality**: Maintainability and performance observations
- **Testing Recommendations**: Coverage gaps and test improvement suggestions

#### Acting on AI Suggestions
1. **Evaluate Critically**: AI suggestions are advisory, not mandatory
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Always validate AI-suggested changes
3. **Document Decisions**: Explain why you accepted or rejected suggestions
4. **Maintain Ownership**: You remain responsible for all code changes

### Auto-Labeling System

#### How It Works
The auto-labeler analyzes your PR and applies relevant labels:

**Component Labels**:
- `component:backend` - Python/backend changes
- `component:frontend` - JavaScript/HTML/CSS changes  
- `component:ai` - AI-related modifications
- `component:security` - Security-sensitive changes
- `component:documentation` - Documentation updates

**Size Labels**:
- `size:small` (â‰¤20 lines) - Quick reviews
- `size:medium` (21-100 lines) - Standard review process
- `size:large` (101-500 lines) - Enhanced review required
- `size:xlarge` (>500 lines) - Consider breaking up

**Status Labels**:
- `status:ready-for-review` - Meets all requirements
- `status:needs-work` - Issues to address before review

#### Responding to Auto-Labels

**If labeled `needs-tests`**:
```bash
# Add or update tests for your changes
python -m pytest backend/test_*.py  # Run existing tests
python scripts/generate_tests.py --component backend/your_file.py  # Generate new tests
```

**If labeled `needs-documentation`**:
- Update relevant README sections
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Update `Claude.md` for significant architectural changes

**If labeled `security-review`**:
- Ensure security best practices followed
- Document security considerations in PR description
- Be prepared for enhanced review process

### AI Summary Generation

#### Automatic Summaries
Summaries are automatically generated for PRs with 50+ lines of changes. These include:
- Component analysis and impact assessment
- Complexity evaluation and risk factors
- Recommendations for review focus areas

#### Manual Summary Requests
```
# Request summary for smaller PRs:
/claude summarize
/ai-summary
```

#### Using Summaries Effectively
- **Review Before Merging**: Verify summary accuracy
- **Share with Team**: Use summaries for team updates
- **Learn from Analysis**: Understand patterns in your code changes

### Refactor Test Guard

#### Understanding the Guard
The refactor test guard ensures that AI-assisted refactoring includes appropriate test updates:

- **Detects AI Refactors**: Based on commit messages, author patterns, and change signatures
- **Verifies Test Coverage**: Ensures tests are updated when code is refactored
- **Enforces Quality**: Prevents regression risks from unguarded refactoring

#### Working with the Guard

**Best Practices for AI Refactoring**:
1. **Plan Test Updates**: Before refactoring, identify tests that need updates
2. **Atomic Changes**: Keep refactoring and test updates in the same commit
3. **Clear Commit Messages**: Use descriptive messages that indicate refactoring intent
4. **Document Rationale**: Explain why the refactor improves the codebase

**If Guard Fails**:
1. **Review the Analysis**: Check the guard's detection and recommendations
2. **Add Missing Tests**: Update or create tests for refactored functionality
3. **Document Exemptions**: If tests aren't needed, explain why in PR description
4. **Rerun Verification**: Push updates and wait for guard re-evaluation

## Best Practices for AI Collaboration

### Commit Message Guidelines

#### Standard Commits
```bash
git commit -m "feat(backend): add user authentication endpoint"
git commit -m "fix(frontend): resolve navigation menu bug"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
```

#### AI-Assisted Commits
```bash
git commit -m "refactor(backend): AI-assisted optimization of database queries"
git commit -m "feat(ai): claude-generated test coverage for user module"  
git commit -m "docs: AI-generated API documentation updates"
```

#### AI Refactor Commits
```bash
git commit -m "AI-Refactor: restructure consciousness simulation for clarity"
git commit -m "refactor: claude-assisted cleanup of legacy authentication code"
```

### Code Quality Guidelines

#### Reviewing AI-Generated Code
1. **Understand Every Line**: Don't merge code you don't understand
2. **Test Thoroughly**: AI-generated code requires the same testing standards
3. **Check Integration**: Verify compatibility with existing systems
4. **Validate Security**: Extra scrutiny for security-related AI suggestions

#### Maintaining Human Ownership
- **Decision Making**: Humans make final decisions on all code changes
- **Architectural Choices**: AI assists but doesn't dictate architecture
- **Code Responsibility**: Contributors remain accountable for merged code
- **Learning Opportunity**: Use AI collaboration to improve your skills

### Documentation Integration

#### Updating Claude.md
When making significant changes, update `Claude.md` with:
- New component descriptions
- Updated workflow patterns
- Integration guidance for AI assistants
- Architecture decisions and rationale

#### AI Governance Documentation
If you encounter governance issues or have suggestions:
1. Create an issue with the `governance` label
2. Describe the problem or improvement opportunity
3. Suggest specific policy or procedure changes
4. Participate in governance discussions

1. Check GitHub Actions workflow status
2. Verify repository secrets are properly configured
3. Look for error messages in workflow logs
4. Contact maintainers if issues persist

### Auto-Labeling Issues

**Issue**: Incorrect labels applied
**Solution**:
1. Manually remove incorrect labels
2. Add correct labels based on actual changes
3. Create issue if labeling logic needs improvement
4. Use feedback to improve future auto-labeling

**Issue**: Missing expected labels
**Solution**:
1. Check if changes match labeling criteria
2. Manually add missing labels
3. Verify file paths and extensions are recognized
4. Suggest labeling rule improvements

### Refactor Guard Failures

**Issue**: Guard incorrectly detects AI refactor
**Solution**:
1. Review commit messages for AI-triggering keywords
2. Check if author patterns match AI detection rules
3. Add clarification in PR description
4. Contact maintainers for manual override if needed

**Issue**: Guard misses actual AI refactor
**Solution**:
1. Ensure AI refactor commits are properly tagged
2. Include "AI-Refactor" or similar in commit messages
3. Update test coverage as required by policy
4. Report detection gaps for policy improvement

### Summary Generation Problems

**Issue**: AI summary inaccurate or incomplete
**Solution**:
1. Verify PR description provides sufficient context
2. Check if file changes are properly categorized
