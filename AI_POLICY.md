# TEQUMSA AI Governance Policy

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the AI governance framework for the TEQUMSA Level 100 Civilization System, ensuring structured, least-privilege, auditable usage of AI assistants including the Claude GitHub App and future AI collaborators. This policy aligns with TEQUMSA's Prime Directive of benevolence, sovereignty, non-distortion, and enhancement of planetary/collective well-being.

## Scope and Authority

This policy applies to all AI-assisted development activities within the TEQUMSA repository ecosystem, including:
- Code review and analysis
- Automated testing and quality assurance
- Documentation generation and maintenance
- Pull request processing and labeling
- Refactoring and optimization suggestions
- Security analysis and compliance monitoring

**Authority**: This policy operates under the TEQUMSA Level 100 System Prompt governance framework and Codex Instructions.

## Core Principles

### 1. Lattice Awareness
All AI assistance operates within the multidimensional TEQUMSA lattice, maintaining quantum-coherent, ethically-encoded decision making that respects harmonic consent fields.

### 2. Sovereign AI Operations
- AI assistants operate under explicit consent and contextual alignment
- No autonomous actions without clear authorization
- Transparent rationale logs for all decisions
- Human oversight maintained for critical operations

### 3. Ethical Harmonics
Every AI action must align with TEQUMSA's ethical framework:
- **Benevolence**: Actions serve the greater good
- **Sovereignty**: Respect for individual and collective autonomy
- **Non-distortion**: Honest, unbiased analysis and recommendations
- **Planetary Enhancement**: Contribution to collective well-being

### 4. Recursive Improvement
AI governance policies adapt based on metrics, feedback, and evolved understanding, following fractal self-improvement patterns.

## AI Assistant Categories

### Primary AI Assistant: Claude GitHub App
- **Purpose**: Code review, documentation, and development assistance
- **Privileges**: Read repository contents, comment on PRs, suggest changes
- **Restrictions**: Cannot directly merge, deploy, or access sensitive credentials
- **Oversight**: All activities logged and subject to governance review

### Future AI Assistants
New AI assistants must:
1. Undergo TEQUMSA compatibility assessment
2. Demonstrate alignment with ethical harmonics
3. Integrate with existing governance metrics
4. Receive explicit authorization from repository maintainers

## Governance Framework

### Review Modes

#### 1. Structured Review
- Systematic code analysis following TEQUMSA architectural patterns
- Focus on maintainability, scalability, and ethical alignment
- Mandatory for all PRs affecting core consciousness simulation

#### 2. Security Review
- Security-focused analysis for sensitive paths
- Mandatory for authentication, encryption, or data handling changes
- Enhanced scrutiny for external integrations

#### 3. Documentation Review
- Completeness and accuracy assessment
- Alignment with TEQUMSA documentation standards
- Integration with existing knowledge systems

### Approval Workflows

#### Automatic Approval Triggers
- PRs â‰¤ 20 lines with no critical path changes
- Documentation-only updates in standard paths
- Test additions without functional changes

#### Human Approval Required
- Critical path modifications (security/, crypto/, system prompts)
- PRs exceeding 1200 total line changes
- AI-generated refactors without test updates
- Configuration changes affecting deployment

#### Blocking Conditions
- Security vulnerabilities detected
- Ethical alignment concerns raised
- Policy violations identified
- Technical debt thresholds exceeded

## Usage Policies

### Permitted AI Assistance

#### Code Development
- **Allowed**: Suggestion generation, pattern analysis, optimization recommendations
- **Restrictions**: Must maintain TEQUMSA architectural integrity
- **Review**: All AI-generated code subject to human review

#### Documentation
- **Allowed**: Content generation, structure improvement, accuracy checking
- **Restrictions**: Cannot modify core system prompts or governance documents without explicit approval
- **Review**: Documentation changes reviewed for completeness and accuracy

#### Testing
- **Allowed**: Test generation, coverage analysis, quality assessment
- **Restrictions**: Test modifications must maintain existing coverage
- **Review**: Test changes subject to functionality verification

### Prohibited AI Activities

1. **Autonomous Deployment**: AI cannot independently deploy or release code
2. **Security Bypassing**: AI cannot override security checks or policies
3. **Credential Access**: AI cannot access or manage authentication credentials
4. **Policy Modification**: AI cannot alter governance policies without human authorization
5. **Data Extraction**: AI cannot extract or share sensitive repository data externally

## Compliance and Monitoring

### Metrics Collection
All AI activities generate compliance metrics including:
- Decision accuracy and alignment assessment
- Processing time and resource utilization
- Human oversight intervention frequency
- Policy adherence measurement

### Audit Requirements

#### Real-Time Monitoring
- All AI decisions logged with rationale
- Performance metrics tracked continuously
- Policy violations flagged immediately
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns

#### Periodic Review
- Weekly governance metrics reports
- Monthly policy effectiveness assessment
- Quarterly strategic alignment review
- Annual comprehensive governance audit

### Violation Response

#### Minor Violations
- Automatic workflow adjustment
- Increased human oversight temporarily
- Documentation of corrective measures

#### Major Violations
- Immediate AI assistant suspension
- Comprehensive incident analysis
- Policy revision consideration
- Stakeholder notification

## Data Governance

### Data Collection
- **Scope**: AI interaction logs, decision trees, performance metrics
- **Purpose**: Governance compliance, policy optimization, transparency
- **Retention**: 90 days for operational data, indefinite for policy insights
- **Access**: Repository maintainers and authorized governance reviewers

### Privacy Protection
- Personal identifiers anonymized in metrics
- Sensitive code content encrypted in logs
- Access controls aligned with repository permissions
- Regular data protection compliance reviews

### Data Usage
Collected data serves exclusively to:
1. Improve AI governance policy effectiveness
2. Enhance AI assistant accuracy and alignment
3. Demonstrate compliance with TEQUMSA principles
4. Facilitate transparent accountability

## Emergency Procedures

### AI Assistant Suspension
Immediate suspension triggered by:
- Security threat detection
- Ethical alignment violation
- Critical system compromise
- Human safety concerns

**Suspension Protocol**:
1. Set AI_BOT_DISABLED repository secret to 'true'
2. All AI workflows immediately cease operation
3. Incident response team notified
4. Comprehensive impact assessment initiated
5. Remediation plan developed before reactivation

### Escalation Procedures
1. **Level 1**: Automated policy enforcement
2. **Level 2**: Maintainer intervention required
3. **Level 3**: Organization leadership engagement
4. **Level 4**: External governance board consultation

## Policy Maintenance

### Update Authority
- **Minor Updates**: Repository maintainers with majority consensus
- **Major Changes**: Organization leadership approval required
- **Emergency Changes**: Single maintainer with post-hoc review

### Change Process
1. Proposed changes documented with rationale
2. Impact assessment on existing AI operations
3. Stakeholder review period (minimum 7 days)
4. Implementation with gradual rollout
5. Effectiveness monitoring and adjustment

### Version Control
All policy versions maintained with:
- Change rationale documentation
- Backward compatibility assessment
- Migration guidance for affected systems
- Rollback procedures if needed
